# This file describe the general purpose design conclusion and stuff about the group

The brute force group include brute force test (supprise). This is a basic demonstration version of a group, it will include one test first
this test is a brute force attack on SSH, note that is also check is there is any SSH authitication required.

The brute force SSH attack is a simple attack who just try all user names (or a specified list of user names)
and when it founds one it try all passwords (or a specified list of passwords)

Note that this attack if often used randomly at targets and then it wil often use the list version because it is faster, when you try
to brute force a certain device you need to check all options because it is not neccesarry has user name and a password that are in the list, this
can take a long long time up to internity.
